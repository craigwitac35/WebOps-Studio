                <h1>About WebOps Studio</h1>
                <p>Welcome to WebOps Studio ‚Äî a one-man dev shop where resourcefulness meets precision, and every line of code is built with intention. I'm Craig Baumann, a U.S. Army veteran turned self-taught front-end web developer based in Minnesota. This isn't just a portfolio ‚Äî it's a reflection of how I think, build, and hustle.</p>

                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>I didn‚Äôt come up through traditional design school. My path was trial and error, curiosity-fueled all-nighters, and a determination to figure things out from scratch. I'd tinker with broken code like it was a puzzle. No roadmap, just grit. Eventually, things clicked. And then kept clicking.</p>
                <p>As a veteran, I bring a work ethic that‚Äôs second nature ‚Äî disciplined, adaptive, and mission-oriented. When I build a site, it‚Äôs not just about how it looks. It‚Äôs about how it functions, how it performs, and how it holds up under real-world use.</p>

                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p>I specialize in clean, responsive front-end development. I build websites from the ground up ‚Äî no templates, no shortcuts. Whether you need a sleek landing page, a full portfolio site, or something more custom, I design for humans and code for performance.</p>
                <p>Every project I take on starts with a simple question: What does this client actually need? From there, I tailor a solution that fits ‚Äî technically, visually, and functionally.</p>

                <h2>Why I Built WebOps Studio</h2>
                <p>At first, this was just a passion. A place to test ideas, learn by doing, and see how far I could take it. But over time, I realized that my background ‚Äî military precision, relentless problem-solving, and a DIY mindset ‚Äî was an asset. WebOps Studio became the name that wrapped it all together.</p>
                <p>I built this brand to showcase what I can do ‚Äî not just with code, but with care. Every page you see here was made by hand. If I can build this, I can build your next project too.</p>

                <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct communication. I‚Äôm the one doing the work.</li>
                    <li>Clean, scalable code. Always.</li>
                    <li>A collaborative mindset ‚Äî I want to build what you need, not what I assume you want.</li>
                    <li>A developer who actually cares about the outcome.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let‚Äôs make something solid.</p>
