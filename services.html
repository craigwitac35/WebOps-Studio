                <h1>Our Services</h1>
                <p class="intro-text">These are the core services I offer through WebOps Studio. Each is built entirely from scratch — no templates, no shortcuts — and tailored to meet real client needs with clean, responsive, high-performance code.</p>

                        <h3>Custom Website Design</h3>
                        <h4>What it is:</h4>
                        <p>A fully custom, multi-page website built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                        <h4>Why clients need it:</h4>
                        <p>Most templated websites are bloated, slow, or generic. You need a site that reflects your brand, works across devices, and loads fast — without relying on someone else's design.</p>
                        <h4>How my approach is different:</h4>
                        <p>I build every line of code by hand, optimizing for speed, structure, and simplicity. This means faster load times, less breakage, and easier long-term maintenance.</p>
                        <h4>Client value:</h4>
                        <p>A clean, one-of-a-kind website that looks sharp, runs fast, and stands out — because it's built for you, not mass-market use.</p>

                    <article class="service-card-detailed">
                        <h3>Landing Pages</h3>
                        <h4>What it is:</h4>
                        <p>A high-converting, single-page website focused on one goal: getting users to take action (sign up, buy, donate, etc.).</p>
                        <h4>Why clients need it:</h4>
                        <p>Landing pages are crucial for campaigns, launches, or services that need targeted messaging. But a slow or cluttered landing page can kill conversions.</p>
                        <h4>How my approach is different:</h4>
                        <p>I design every layout and element with intention — fast-loading code, zero distractions, mobile-first structure, and a laser focus on the call-to-action.</p>
                        <h4>Client value:</h4>
                        <p>Higher engagement, more signups/sales, and full control over messaging — all without the noise of bloated platforms.</p>

                        <h3>Website Redesign & Cleanup</h3>
                        <h4>What it is:</h4>
                        <p>A full front-end refresh of your existing website, focusing on layout, usability, and performance.</p>
                        <h4>Why clients need it:</h4>
                        <p>If your current site looks outdated, loads slowly, or breaks on mobile — you’re losing visitors (and sales) every day.</p>
                        <h4>How my approach is different:</h4>
                        <p>Instead of patching over bad code, I rebuild it from the ground up using clean, modern standards. I audit your current site, identify pain points, and rebuild only what’s necessary.</p>
                        <h4>Client value:</h4>
                        <p>A faster, better-looking, more responsive version of your current site — one that users actually enjoy using.</p>

                    <article class="service-card-detailed">
                        <h3>Mobile Optimization</h3>
                        <h4>What it is:</h4>
                        <p>Custom restructuring and styling of your site to look and perform perfectly on all mobile devices.</p>
                        <h4>Why clients need it:</h4>
                        <p>Over 60% of web traffic is mobile — and if your site doesn’t work well on phones, you're losing most of your audience.</p>
                        <h4>How my approach is different:</h4>
                        <p>I code responsive breakpoints and adaptive layouts by hand — not relying on generic framework classes — so your site scales naturally across screen sizes.</p>
                        <h4>Client value:</h4>
                        <p>A mobile-first experience that improves accessibility, speed, and engagement — especially for users on the go.</p>

                        <h3>Contact & Form Integration</h3>
                        <h4>What it is:</h4>
                        <p>Custom-coded contact forms, message capture forms, and functional front-end integrations for user outreach.</p>
                        <h4>Why clients need it:</h4>
                        <p>You need more than just an email address on a page — forms create trust, streamline communication, and make it easier for clients or customers to reach you.</p>
                        <h4>How my approach is different:</h4>
                        <p>I design and code forms manually, ensuring they match your design, validate input properly, and can be wired up with your email or backend.</p>
                        <h4>Client value:</h4>
                        <p>A professional, working contact system that feels like part of your brand — not a clunky afterthought.</p>

                        <h3>Front-End Refactoring</h3>
                        <h4>What it is:</h4>
                        <p>An audit and cleanup of your current site’s front-end code, focusing on structure, performance, and scalability.</p>
                        <h4>Why clients need it:</h4>
                        <p>Over time, many sites become bloated and buggy. Refactoring is like tuning your engine — it keeps things clean, lean, and future-ready.</p>
                        <h4>How my approach is different:</h4>
                        <p>I don't just rearrange code — I strip out what you don't need, re-organize what you do, and rebuild logic in a way that makes sense. All done without breaking your current visual design.</p>
                        <h4>Client value:</h4>
                        <p>A leaner, faster site that’s easier to maintain, more SEO-friendly, and future-proofed for growth.</p>
